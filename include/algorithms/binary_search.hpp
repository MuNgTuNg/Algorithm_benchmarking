                 Binary Search
                    Space complexity = O(1)
                        Binary search does not take up any extra space, so works
                        in constant space

                    Time complexity = O(log n)
                        Best case time complexity is O(1) when the middle value exactly
                        matches the target number.

                        worst case is O(log n), where each search makes the necessary search
                        half as large by dividing by 2. A logarithm is the opposite of an exponential
                        function. 
                        e.g x = yÂ² is the same as  x = log(y)2

Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm, designed to optimise the search for a given value.
